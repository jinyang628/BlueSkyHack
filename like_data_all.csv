But @taylorlorenz.bsky.social did give us a tool for working the folks between us and fascists in it.",52
"Yeag QS is my POV on that. 

Arguing with a bigot is never to change the minds of the bigot or their supporters, it’s for the folks watching. Nothing short of deprogramming will “save” most committed fascists but the left is, generally, spectacularly bad at using *all* tools available to us.",38
I’m just hoping to gods that the rest of the left wing media folks jump at this opportunity to drown her out with the direct links Taylor made between her and the murder of a child within a district she was politically influential over before Chaya can try and push back.,14
"Because Chaya is used to operating in controlled, time limited environments (why she had her jr. propagandist and originally only was giving Taylor 5 minutes) but she let her greed for attention win out and gave an hour long interview of zero preparation outright fascist quotes for the harvesting.",45

"Because the fascists are just fighting for fascism, and the left is basically just a coalition of minorities all doing our own thing to survive mainly instead of fighting with a coherent purpose beyond “oh gods they want us dead” in multiple ways

Which is why we go “wtf” at tactics we don’t know.",17
Like. None of this is a “one fell swoop wins all the marbles” battle.

And the way the article presents the FBI telling parents to get their kids off the fucking internet as some kind of scandal when it's actually the frustration of someone who WORKS IN CHILD EXPLOITATION PREVENTION telling people to stop fucking sexually exploiting their fucking kids!,39
The correct answer to what these parents are complaining about is that their accounts should be closed and they should be blocked from the platform.,77
"But that doesn't change the fact that child beauty pagent and influencer accounts *are* sexual exploitation of minors and always have been. They're just culturally accepted forms of sexual exploitation of minors. If you try to push back against that, you get immense shit, but it's true.",153
"I think the NYT article does place too much blame on Meta, because there have been times in the past when platforms have tried to crack down on this kind of content -- and been vilified for it. (""How dare you say my account that's sexually exploiting my child is sexually exploiting my child!"")",101
"They don't want to face the fact they're exploiting their children: the only reason child ""influencer"" accounts make money is because of the creeps in the first place. They aren't selling their children to be sexually abused directly, but they are sexually exploiting their children.",142
"Child beauty pageants and certain types of dance and cheer competitions have always been a form of softcore child exploitation, and there's always been a huge market for that kind of content. The parents in that article complaining they need more tools to handle the creeps are fucking hypocrites.",155
"The narrative whenever these types of accounts are highlighted in the media is how the Big Evil Platforms are Enabling Child Exploitation, but it's not the platforms: it's the parents. This kind of child exploitation content has always existed -- remember Toddlers & Tiaras?",199
"Thanks to the folks who sent me a gift link version of this -- I deleted the ask (so more people didn't burn a gift link when I already had one) but if you want to read it too, it's www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/u... and both the article and David's thread here get at a bit of the complexity.",134
"Except every time they've tried in the past, these parents have thrown a fucking fit. The problem, for once, is not with Meta. The problem is with our society thinking ""sexual exploitation of children"" looks like one specific thing and refusing to hear that a lot of ""tame"" content is exploitation.",120
Saying Meta should be giving parents who are sexually exploiting their minor children more tools to handle the direct interaction from people who are consuming the sexual exploitation of minors is the wrong ask. Meta should be preventing parents from exploiting their children in the first place.,168
"a lot of the work of content moderation involves who is going to yell at you, and why, and how much, and if it’s worth the trouble

"Compare UK's influence in 2024 to its influence in 1996 or 2002, or hell, 2008 for example. Just ... utterly vast",7
The UK's weird obsession and rejection of freedom of movement is just so tragically self-defeating. The shrinking horizons of not being able to live and work anywhere on the continent because ... you don't like foreign people. Tragic loss,27
"Not really, but it's going to have to join the Euro and align itself back to all the EU regulations, which is a non-starter in the UK for the forseeable future, and nobody in the EU is going to bother having that conversation until that changes.",17

"Not even ceremonially own, Chucky Three Sticks is distinctly and separately the King of Canada.",4
"I mean ... ""own"" for purely ceremonial values of ""own"". If the UK decided to exert authority over Canada against Canadian wishes, Canada would be a republic within a week",31
The funny one to me is always how the UK has this gigantic sense of itself which view is shared pretty much only by ... Russia of all places,62
"Americans do like the UK, probably more positive sentiment and visible presence than any other country still. But it’s a cultural, historical, and linguistic affinity, not because anybody thinks our national security depends on the alliance. And it’s not even much economic connection, either.",27
"Other than that it's a country that is mostly famous for harry potter and the queen, and most people don't think about those things even to the extent of realizing there's no longer even a queen",38

"To the average American, the UK is a theme park entertainment complex and not much else.",23
"The UK, with respect, has a very overinflated sense of how important they are to the US or how much the US gives a shit about their self-inflicted economic problems that mostly don't directly affect the US",116
"Not sure Biden cares much about the UK's woes, and the EU wouldn't go for it anyway regardless of how much the UK wants it back. Gonna be a while in the wilderness before anyone in Europe will entertain it again after the clusterfuck that was the exit",87
"Not announced yet; but must be before end of Jan, but most folks think ~ Oct, and some folks saying as soon as May.",23
Never has a party so deserved to get wrecked in the way they are about to,87
"not the only thing in there, but the extent to which rightwing parties have gone all-in on extreme anti-immigrant stuff as their central recruiter and GOTV thing is depressing",94
"Glenn Kirschner’s hot takes have grown barely tepid. His fires have ebbed, and like the dimmest Boy Scout, the one who keeps snort-laughing and tripping over tent spikes, he fumbles at kindling new ones.  Now he loiters, embers spent, foraging for stale danishes in MSNBC’s green rooms.",145
This sophomoric effort to elide “mistakes” (which everyone makes) and “fraud” (something else entirely) is just gross and infuriating.,84
I don’t understand how they exclude other possibilities like it being spent on cocaine or hookers or attorney fees or something,137
"if i started claiming i spent two seasons as a backup catcher for the detroit tigers in 2005-2006, is that a lie you all would help me perpetuate? seems like a fun story i might not ever be called out on, especially if enough of you went along with it",711
